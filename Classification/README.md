# Classification

### Classifications on many datasets from the [University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
### For each dataset I include an analysis of the data in the readme.  This contains my thought process for how I pre-processed the data and designed the classifier.  Complete code of pre-processing and classification is also included.
